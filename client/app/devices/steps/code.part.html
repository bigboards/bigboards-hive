        Well done, your device has been created!
    </p>
    <p class="md-body-1">
        If you already have installed the fabric on your nodes you can link them to {{ device.name }} by running
        the following command on the commandline:
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace">
        your-device # <strong>bb link {{ device.security_code }}</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="md-body-1">
        Once your node is linked to {{ device.name }} it can be used to provision tints to it.
    </p>

    <p class="md-body-1">
        You can also choose to skip this step and add nodes to {{ device.name }} at some later point. You can find the
        security_code to use for adding devices to your hex on in your device list. ( It is <strong>{{ device.security_code }}</strong>, in case you want to write it down. )
