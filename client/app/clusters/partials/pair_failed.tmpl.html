    We were unable to pair the cluster, which might mean that the pair_code has expired.
    You can generate a new pair code and try again to pair the device from the hive:

<ul class="m-l-30">
    <li>Generate a new pair code on your hardware device</li>
    <li>Use that new code to link the cluster again</li>
</ul>
